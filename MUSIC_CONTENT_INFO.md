# Music Content Information for Apple App Store Review

## Response to Apple Review Questions

### 1. Who are the artists that compose the music and audio content found within the app?

**Answer**: The music content in the LifeTunes app consists entirely of **sample/demo tracks** with fictional artist names. These are not real musical compositions or recordings. The app currently contains placeholder music data used for demonstration and testing purposes only.

**Current Sample Tracks**:
- "Morning Energy" by "LifeTunes" (fictional)
- "City Vibes" by "Urban Sounds" (fictional)
- "Peaceful Moments" by "Calm Collective" (fictional)
- "Workout Beast" by "Fitness Beats" (fictional)
- "Study Focus" by "Concentration" (fictional)
- "Evening Chill" by "Relaxation" (fictional)
- "Adventure Time" by "Explorer" (fictional)
- "Creative Flow" by "Inspiration" (fictional)

### 2. Are these independent 3rd party artists, or is the music composed specifically to be in the LifeTunes app?

**Answer**: Neither. The current music content in the app is **placeholder data only**. There are no actual audio files or musical compositions included in the app. The "tracks" are metadata entries (title, artist name, duration, genre, mood) used to demonstrate the app's playlist and mood-matching functionality.

## Technical Implementation Details

- **No Audio Files**: The app contains no actual .mp3, .wav, or other audio files
- **Metadata Only**: Only track information (titles, durations, genres) for UI demonstration
- **Simulated Playback**: The "play" functionality shows UI states but does not play actual audio
- **Demo Purpose**: All music-related content is for demonstrating the app's core mood-mapping and wellness features

## Future Implementation

In a production version, the app would:
1. Integrate with legitimate music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
2. Use properly licensed music content
3. Implement real audio playback capabilities
4. Comply with all music licensing requirements

## Core App Functionality

The main purpose of LifeTunes is **mood tracking and wellness**, not music streaming. The music component serves as a supportive feature to help users:
- Associate moods with environmental contexts
- Track emotional patterns across locations
- Encourage wellness activities through challenges

The app's primary value is in its location-based mood mapping and wellness tracking capabilities, with music serving as a contextual enhancement rather than the core offering.
