	<string>LifeTunes needs your location to create personalized music playlists based on where you are. For example: when you're at a gym, the app will automatically suggest high-energy workout music; when you're at a park, it will recommend calming nature sounds; when you're at home, it will create relaxing evening playlists. Your location is also used to build a personal mood map that shows which places make you feel happiest, helping you make better choices about where to spend your time. Location data is processed locally on your device and is never shared with third parties.</string>
	<key>NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription</key>
	<string>LifeTunes sends you daily wellness reminders and motivational challenges to help maintain your mental health routine. For example, you'll receive a gentle reminder at 7 PM to log your mood or a motivational quote to start your day.</string>
