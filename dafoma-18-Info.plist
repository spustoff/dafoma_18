	<string>LifeTunes uses your location to create personalized, location-based music playlists and mood tracking. Specifically: 1) Generate geo-tuned playlists that match your surroundings (for example, relaxing nature sounds when you're in a park, upbeat workout music when you're at the gym, or focus music when you're in a library), 2) Create a personalized mood map by recording where you log your emotions to help you identify patterns between locations and your wellbeing, and 3) Provide location-specific music recommendations based on the time of day and your current environment.</string>
	<key>NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription</key>
	<string>LifeTunes sends you daily wellness reminders and motivational challenges to help maintain your mental health routine. For example, you'll receive a gentle reminder at 7 PM to log your mood or a motivational quote to start your day.</string>
