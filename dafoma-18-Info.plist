	<string>LifeTunes uses your location to automatically create personalized music experiences and track your emotional wellness patterns. Specifically, the app will: 1) Generate location-based playlists that match your surroundings - for example, when you're at a park, the app will create a calming nature playlist with birds sounds and acoustic music; when you're at a gym, it will generate high-energy workout tracks; when you're in a coffee shop, it will suggest focus music with ambient sounds, 2) Build your personal mood map by recording the location where you log your daily emotions, helping you discover which places boost your mood (like that favorite hiking trail) versus places that stress you (like busy intersections), enabling you to make more informed choices about where you spend time, and 3) Provide intelligent music recommendations that consider both your current location and time of day - suggesting energizing morning playlists when you're at home, relaxing evening music when you're commuting, or motivational tracks when you're at your workplace.</string>

	<string>LifeTunes sends you daily wellness reminders and motivational challenges to help maintain your mental health routine. For example, you'll receive a gentle reminder at 7 PM to log your mood or a motivational quote to start your day.</string>
